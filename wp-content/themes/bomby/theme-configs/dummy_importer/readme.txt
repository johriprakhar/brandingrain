How to create export files:

1. Create a menu called "Primary" if you want to assign to main menu automatically on import.
2. If page is used as front page use slug "homepage" for the page. Otherwise it won't be assigned automatically.
2. Use http://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-settings-importexport/ to export widgets and save in sample-data folder as widget_data.json.
3. Export Redux settings in Appearance>Theme options>Import/Export. Click "Download Data File" and save file in sample-data folder as redux.json.
4. Use WP exporter to export content. Go to Tools>Export, choose "All Content" radio button and click "Download Export File". Save file as data.xml in sample-data folder.
