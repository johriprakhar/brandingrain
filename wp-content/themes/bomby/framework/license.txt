// Ivan Framework License
//

Aside ThemeForest Standard license - a few items must be respected when using Ivan Framework as base of a theme that will/are sold.

You CAN'T:

- From these theme files, derivate more themes to sell without the proper license agreement between Ivan Framework Owner and you (the seller)
- Copy the features and implementation techniques used by the framework in other themes that will be sold

In plain english, you can't use this theme or the features implemented (the code) in other themes that will be sold.
